6. Merge to main after approval

### Code Quality Standards
- Write TypeScript for all components
- Include JSDoc comments for functions
- Follow Airbnb style guide
- Write tests for all utility functions
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper error handling

### Git Workflow
- Main branch: Production-ready code
- Develop branch: Integration branch
- Feature branches: Individual features
- Format: feature/phase-name-description

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for utilities
- Component tests for interactive elements
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for artwork grid
- Cross-browser testing

This plan is designed to be iterative and flexible. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation before adding more complex features. The timeline can be adjusted based on team size and availability.
